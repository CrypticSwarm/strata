Strata is a fast, streaming web framework for node.js that is patterned after
time-honored and battle tested web application design principles pioneered in
the Python and Ruby communities (see WSGI and Rack). Using Strata, developers
can build highly performant web servers in a powerful, modular style that is
easy to maintain and takes full advantage of the streaming capabilities and
excellent I/O handling of node.js.

The core Strata distribution consists of three things:

  - A specification (see SPEC) for building applications and middleware
  - A library (see lib) with many useful utilities and middleware to aid
    developers in the common tasks of building applications that conform to
    the specification
  - An executable (see bin/strata) for running Strata applications from the
    command line

# Installation

Using npm:

  $ npm install strata

You are also free to browse or download the source at
https://github.com/mjijackson/strata.

# Examples

The example directory contains many extensively-documented files written in a
tutorial style that are also runnable. These should help you get up to speed
quickly on how to use Strata.

See example/README for more information.

# Tests

To run the tests, first install vows:

  $ npm install -g vows

Run all tests with:

  $ vows test/*_test.js

Otherwise, run the tests for a specific module with:

  $ vows test/utils_test.js

# Credits

Strata was inspired by similar efforts in the Python and Ruby communities,
namely WSGI and Rack. It borrows many code patterns from these libraries, as
well as the JSGI project.

Strata's multipart parser is based on the fast parser in the node-formidable
project written by Felix Geisend√∂rfer. It is included in Strata under the terms
of the MIT license.

My sincere thanks to the authors of each of these libraries for the excellent
work they've done and graciously shared.
