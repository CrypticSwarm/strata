This directory contains example files that explain how to use various features
of the Strata framework. All files contain detailed comments that explain the
code and are runnable using the strata executable.

For example, to run the 01_hello.js example use the following command:

    $ strata 01_hello.js

Then open your browser to http://localhost:1982/.

Note: The above command assumes that you have already installed Strata on your
system. Please see the project README for instructions on how to do this.

The examples have been written in such a way that more complex examples build
upon principles discussed in more trivial ones. The number prefix to each of the
example file names indicates its relative order in the hierarchy of complexity.
Thus, it is recommended to start with lower numbered examples when getting
started with Strata and work your way up to higher ones.
